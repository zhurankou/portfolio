      <h1>OneDrive Sharing <br>Dialog redesign</h1>
      <p>Objective: Improving sharing experience by addressing our customers’ concerns</p>

      <h2>Contribution</h2>
      <p>I led the sharing experience redesign initiative across the OneDrive web and mobile entry points, in collaboration with a cross-functional team of UX designers, project managers, and engineers, to enhance its features.</p>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>OneDrive owns the Sharing Dialog. It appears in more than 40 endpoints across Microsoft365 family of products. In 2019 our research team conducted a benchmark study and compared OneDrive’s sharing experience to Google Drive and Box.</p>

      <p>Even though the overall functionality received a high score, the OneDrive’s sharing experience scored the lowest. We identified several design drawbacks such as inconsistent headers and placement, hidden Role Selector, and unbalanced width.</p>

      <p>Users also couldn’t associate link type with the “Copy link” experience.</p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>We organized a series of brainstorming sessions with our partner teams from Microsoft365. After many meetings and design iterations, we settled on a version that addressed all these design problems.</p>
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing8.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing9.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <p>The main idea of the new design was to split user flow into a series of simple decisions (“Email link” plus “Copy link” and other share targets) instead of complicating the sharing dialog surface with all these options.</p>
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing10.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <p>We made consistent headers across all the endpoints, brought the Role selector into the sharing dialog surface, and increased the width to give the elements a breath.</p>
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing11.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <p>We introduced a combined “Email link” and “Copy link” experience in the list view on office.com and OneDrive since we couldn’t afford the share menu there.</p>
      <h2>User testing</h2>
      <p>To test our assumptions and gather qualitative data we conducted two user studies.</p>

      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing28.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <!-- <img src="../images/sharing/sharing32.png" alt="Sharing dialog"> -->
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing33.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>The positive feedback reassured our design direction and we planned incremental updates to our current version.</p>
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing17.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing18.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing19.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing20.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing21.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <p>This approach allowed us to observe the telemetry and assess our design decisions with quantitative data.</p>
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing35.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <p>As a result, the redesign of the sharing dialog led to a remarkable 34% surge in user engagement and completion of sharing actions. Given that the sharing feature experiences approximately 40 million openings per month, the team's accomplishments are truly impressive.</p>
      <!-- <h2>Next steps and concepts</h2>
      <p>OneDrive will eventually switch to Fluent icons and look more modern, mobile-friendly, and visually pleasant.</p>

      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing25.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <img src="../images/sharing/sharing26.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
      <p>Beyond the conservative design, I also explore concepts with more experimental ideas.</p> -->
