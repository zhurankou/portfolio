      <h1>OneDrive Sharing Dialog redesign</h1>
      <p><b>How might we improve sharing experience by addressing our customers’ concerns.</b></p>

  <main class="container project">
    <h2>Problems with previous version</h2>
    <p>OneDrive owns the Sharing Dialog. It appears in more than 40 endpoints across Microsoft products. In 2019 our research team conducted a benchmark study and compared OneDrive’s sharing experience to Google Drive and Box.</p>

    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing1.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <p>Even though the overall functionality received a high score, the OneDrive’s sharing experience scored the lowest. We identified several design drawbacks such as inconsistent headers and placement, hidden Role Selector, and unbalanced width.</p>

    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing7.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <p>Users also couldn’t associate link type with the “Copy link” experience.</p>
    <h2>Brainstorming and design explorations</h2>
    <p>We organized a series of brainstorming sessions with our partner teams from Office 365. After many meetings and design iterations, we settled on a version that addressed all these design problems.</p>
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing8.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing9.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <p>The main idea of the new design was to split user flow into a series of simple decisions (“Email link” plus “Copy link” and other share targets) instead of complicating the sharing dialog surface with all these options.</p>
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing10.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing11.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <p>We made consistent headers across all the endpoints, brought the Role selector into the sharing dialog surface, and increased the width to give the elements a breath. We introduced a combined “Email link” and “Copy link” experience in the list view on office.com and OneDrive since we couldn’t afford the share menu there.</p>
    <h2>User testing and planning</h2>
    <p>To test our assumptions and gather qualitative data we conducted two user studies.</p>

    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing31.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing28.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing32.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing33.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <p>The positive feedback reassured our design direction and we planned incremental updates to our current version.</p>
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing17.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing18.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing19.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing20.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing21.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing23.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <p>This approach allowed us to observe the telemetry and assess our design decisions with quantitative data.</p>
    <h2>Next steps and concepts</h2>
    <p>OneDrive will eventually switch to Fluent icons and look more modern, mobile-friendly, and visually pleasant.</p>

    <img src="../images/sharing/sharing26.png" alt="Sharing dialog">
    <p>Beyond the conservative design, I also explore concepts with more experimental ideas.</p>
