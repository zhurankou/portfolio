      <h1>OneDrive Link Settings redesign</h1>
      <p>How might we improve sharing experience by helping our customers with applying the right share settings.</p>

      <h2>Link settings user feedback</h2>
      <p>OneDrive’s Link Settings Dialog allows to scope the audience, change editorial permissions and apply additional security features like “Block download”, “Expiration  date”, etc. After conducting the benchmark study, we identified several drawbacks in the current design.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings19.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings1.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings2.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings3.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings4.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings5.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>The “Link settings” title wasn’t clear, especially for customers coming from other cloud products; the scope names were “confusing”; people had difficulties choosing between them.</p>
      <h2>Design explorations</h2>
      <p>During the sharing experience brainstorming sessions, we also ran a design sprint to explore how we can improve all the drawbacks.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings13.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>We renamed the dialog to “Sharing settings” so users would not associate this experience only with links.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings10.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>We rewrote the scope names to make them shorter and easier to comprehend.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings11.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>We introduced info-buttons with scope descriptions to inform people of their capabilities.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings12.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>We added the Manage access entry point to the “People with existing access” scope so users could look up who these people are.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings7.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>We introduced the “Role selector” dropdown inside the settings dialog to make this experience coherent.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings8.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings9.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>Besides that, we designed the seamless external sharing flow when people need to click only once to change link settings from “company” to “specific people.” </p>
      <h2>User research and iterations</h2>
      <p>Then we tested our new design conducting a user research study.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings6.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>We received split results and organized a wall review with designers from outside the feature team and engineers to find other feasible solutions.</p>
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings14.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings17.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings15.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings16.png" alt="Dialog">
      <img src="../images/link-settings/link-settings18.png" alt="Dialog">
      <p>In this version, we chose to show selected scope descriptions on the surface; updated scope strings to make them clear; transformed the Manage access entry point into face-piles so people could see who the file "shared with" at a glance.</p>
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>Soon, we will be moving this project into engineering and conducting AB experiments in our “dogfood” environment.</p>
