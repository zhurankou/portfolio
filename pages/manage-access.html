      <h1>Manage Access entry point redesign</h1>
      <p>How might we improve sharing experience by addressing our customers’ concerns</p>

      <h2>Contribution</h2>
      <p>I led the sharing experience redesign initiative across the OneDrive web and mobile entry points, in collaboration with a cross-functional team of UX designers, project managers, and engineers, to enhance its features, including Manage Access entry point.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>OneDrive sharing links technology is powerful, which allows people to scope the audience based on their affiliation to a company, groups, access history, etc. That brings complexity into managing access experience and often causes frustration. </p>

      <p>Because of that OneDrive can not afford to implement patterns familiar to people from products like Google Drive, Dropbox, Box.</p>

      <p>Besides that, the Manage access entry point in the old experience was hidden inside the “more” button and the details pane.</p>
      <h2>Explorations</h2>
      <p>During the Sharing dialog brainstorming sessions and design sprints with our Office 365 partners, we also explored how to improve the Manage access entry point experience. </p>

      <img src="../images/manage-access/manage-access6.png" alt="Manage Access entry point design">
      <p>After many iterations, we finalized a couple of ideas and organized an experience wall review with engineers. We received feedback that the face-piles inside the share menu are not feasible due to technical limitations, so we iterated on this idea and transformed it into a simple Manage Access menu item. When the design was settled, we planned a user testing research study.</p>
      <h2>User testing</h2>
      <p>To test our assumptions and gather qualitative data we conducted the Shared with section user study.</p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>The positive feedback reassured our assumptions with qualitative data, and we planned implementation of this design into our production cycle.</p>

      <p>As a result, the introduction of the new entry point led to a remarkable 64% surge in user engagement. Given that the sharing feature experiences approximately 40 million openings per month, the team's accomplishments are truly impressive.</p>
      <p>The quantitative data showed that people were more intentional about who and whom they share with and felt more confident.</p>
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>Soon, we will launch our new Manage access experience with a people-centric design and observe how this change affects the sharing dialog metrics as a whole.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
